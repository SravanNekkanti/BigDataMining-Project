# The dataset we used is given as “US_Accidents_Data.csv” in the OneDrive but we mentioned it as “US_Accidents_March23.csv” in all the Python notebooks/code we used. Please do check and consider.

## initialAnalysis.ipynb - Provides more knowledge about the dataset and it’s features. Also, the Preprocessing of the dataset is performed.
## ML_models.ipynb - Few visualizations about the accident frequency and severity are performed. Several Machine Learning Modelling Techniques such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), # Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) were performed against the dataset.
## Visualizations.ipynb - Various visualizations from the data were performed from which conclusions were obtained.
## hyperParameterTuning.ipynb - Hyperparameter Tuning has been performed using GridSearchCV.
## us_accidents_heatmap.html - Interactive severity based accident heatmap
